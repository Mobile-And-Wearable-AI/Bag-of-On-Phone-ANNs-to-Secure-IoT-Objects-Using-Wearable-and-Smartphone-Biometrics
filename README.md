# Bag-of-On-Phone-ANNs-to-Secure-IoT-Objects-Using-Wearable-and-Smartphone-Biometrics
Feature Set of the biometrics used in multi-modal wearables authentication

In order to experiment with the data and modeling codes, first, download the data files and the python modeling file (nn_model_testing.py). You need to enable the GPU in the Google Colab machine configuration to run the codes. Once you run the py file, you will get the optimal NN model using the selected data. For example, once you run the  HG_10pData_withNoise dataset, you will get the optimal ANN models using heart rate and gait (H = Heart Rate, G = Gait, B = Breathing).
