Feature Set of the biometrics used in multi-modal wearables authentication

This repository houses the feature set generated and used in "Bag of On-Phone ANNs to Secure IoT Objects Using Wearable and Smartphone Biometrics". We seek to explore the use of heart rate, gait, and breathing in an implicit continuous authentication scheme leveraging commonly found IoT wearables. The have the feature set and the scripts used to generate them. Due to privacy policies the raw data from the participances are omitted.
